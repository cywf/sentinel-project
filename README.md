## What is the Sentinel Project?

The Sentinel Project is a cutting-edge security system that uses the latest technologies and innovative thinking to reduce human interaction with security incidents and events. Designed by FolkvarLabs, the Sentinel Project features a set of highly specialized and fine-tuned "Sentries" that can be deployed to protect various critical infrastructure industries, such as Energy, Water, Transportation, Communications, Banking and Finance, and more.

Each Sentry is designed to think for itself and provide real-time threat intelligence and incident response, ensuring that your infrastructure is always protected from harm. With the Sentinel Project, you can rest assured that your critical infrastructure is secure, even in the face of the most advanced threats.

This repository serves as the main hub for the Sentinel Project, containing all the necessary documentation, source code, and other resources for getting started with the project. Whether you're interested in contributing to the project or just want to learn more about the Sentinel Project and its various Sentries, you'll find everything you need right here.
